    <p><p><b>Ode to Duality</b></p><p>The effervescent lights, they animate into darkness. 
The transmission begins in the noonday until night. 
It appeals to tactile senses, waiting.</p><p>Water purifies the hills in the distance. 
Love a tree in the forest of fragrance. 
The passing of time an ode to duality.</p><p><b>Unleashing</b></p><p>What hell hath we unleashed upon this sacred land? 
Fiery seas rage over already-barren deserts. 
A single pin drop heard. Then, a wave of fury descends
Under and over every surface, breaking through all.</p><p><b>Life as a Pawn</b></p><p>John gets enticed to join a chess club. He&#39;s curious about chess (his father was a casual chess player) and chess culture, and was happy to get to know some friends there. After a while he becomes so in love with the club that he decides to study event management, so he can serve the chess club by organising events and stuff. One day, a chess master comes into the school as the new teacher. He decimates every student in the club. Suddenly it dawned on John that what he joined is actually about chess, the game.  The end.</p><p>In reality, John knew that club was about chess, the game. It was perhaps to please his father; or perhaps there was something genuinely captivating about the game: the search for the winning strategy, the interaction with other members to hear what their strategies are. The club was never about winning though, it was more about the social interactions, at least not until this new teacher showed up. &#39;Shit got real&#39;, and it did so very quickly.</p><p>John grew up, that day. There was a couple of reasons why he decided to stop going to the chess club: first, he would have to be a professional chess player, but there would be no money in that. He did consider it seriously though. Second, it was either in or out, to be a pro, or never to touch chess again so long as he could avoid it. But there was a third reason. If this new teacher could win at chess, why couldn&#39;t John be like the teacher (to win), but in life? Chess is a game, but life is more. That was his coping mechanism perhaps, to let the teacher win in his domain while he excels in all other domains but this one.</p><p>Of course, John would later learn that &#39;life&#39; is a very general term. Winning in life would require so much more than just a commitment, a personal give-and-take. But he could no longer treat games seriously. He has grown up now, and things of childhood no longer appeal. But deep down, he searches for that feeling that he once had during the times when he was in the chess club, just replicated in real world activities.</p><p>But for years he would not be able to talk about the chess club, there was just too much, too soon. He would have to answer inane questions like, &#39;why did you quit the chess club?&#39; and &#39;do you still like chess?&quot;, and he finds that he has to betray himself sometimes by saying things he didn&#39;t quite mean, just so he could form an answer. To the outside world, John would seem like a cold (and even fickle) person who was unable to keep an interest long enough to be good at something. He believes this sometimes, too, in the darkest of moments.</p><p>Believe it or not, he stumbled into people who are against chess! They speak of how chess creates an illusion of life and makes people (chess players) have a distorted view of the world. There is some sense in this, John considers, but in the end he adheres to that belief only as a way out of conversations. He&#39;s against chess, and these anti-chess people may be right, but he doesn&#39;t want to yet fall into another club.</p><p>While he wrestles with his views on chess, he has had to deal with many other life issues. Chores to be done, people he has to relate to. What would he do, now that he has completed the event management course?  He can&#39;t go back and organise chess events anymore. Many people around him (those in and out of the chess club) have gone on to senior roles in their chosen fields by now. His aversion to join another club has kept him solitary, but was compounded by the fact that his earlier friends are in a different state of life, for better or for worse. So he decides to start his life anew. He had only made that one mistake in his life (to join the chess club), so if he could just reverse time (so to speak, if only in his head), he could use the remainder of his life to do what he would have done if only he didn&#39;t choose the misguided path.
